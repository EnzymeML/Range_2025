# Supporting information for the Range et al. paper on MD-Models

The repository is structured as follows:

- [`Calibration`](Calibration): Contains the code and data for the calibration for calculating the concentration for photometric ABTS measurements.
- [`EnzymeML_Documents`](EnzymeML_Documents): Contains the EnzymeML Documents for the reaction of ABTS with SLAC. The EnzymeML Documents are used by both the `Calibration` and `Modelling` folders.
- [`Modelling`](Modelling): Contains the code and data for the modelling of the reaction of ABTS with SLAC.
- [`Figures`](Figures): Contains the code to recreate the modelling overview figure of the paper.
